# ME 507 - Teleoperated Robot Hand
By: Sydney Alexander & Jorge Ramirez

This repository holds all the work done for our Fall 2025 ME 507 mechatronics 
class, Mechanical Control System Design. We choose to do a teleoperated
robot hand for our final project. The robot hand is controlled by a glove
that can be worn by the user. The user has control over each finger and a
palm bending motion on the robot hand.

The repository is split into 3 parts: 
* Mechanical Design Files
* PCB Files
* Software Files.
